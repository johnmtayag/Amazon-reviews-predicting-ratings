    "# Analyzing Customer Reviews from Amazon\n",

    "### Analysis of the data and Rating prediction\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of this project is to analyze customer reviews of different headphones listings on Amazon. The reviews will be split into \"good\" and \"bad\" sets, and the review texts will be processed into tokens consisting of individual words. These will form the \"good\" and \"bad\" review corpuses that will be analyzed to determine the most important words in either good and bad review sets. They will also be used to predict if a review will be \"good\" or \"bad.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "This analysis has many real-world applications. While customers can manually include ratings for the product in their reviews, this rating is only an overall statement"

Pain in ear due the conical buds(can be removed)3. Wires are a bit long which makes it odd in front.4. No pouch provided.5. Worst part is very low quality and distoring mic.

    "I will create two class bins - \"good\" reviews consisting of 4/5 star reviews, and \"bad\" reviews consisting of all others (1-3 star reviews). This is technically still skewed toward the good review category, but this is a fairly accurate representation of sentiment - a 4 star rating or better would typically be considered good on a 5 star spectrum.\n",

       "1 Honest review of an edm music lover\\n No doubt it has a great bass and to a great extent noise cancellation and decent sound clarity and mindblowing battery but the following dissapointed me though i tried a lot to adjust.1.Bluetooth range not more than 10m2. Pain in ear due the conical buds(can be removed)3. Wires are a bit long which makes it odd in front.4. No pouch provided.5. Worst part is very low quality and distoring mic. Other person keeps complaining about my voice.\\n                              \n",
       "2 Unreliable earphones with high cost\\n This  earphones are unreliable, i bought it before 15 days meanwhile right side ear buds got cracked automatically and it got divided in two parts, and sound quality is also not that much good but ok, one more thing bass is not good as it is a boat earphones.Guys,Also for the proof i have attached picsPlease see and think before buying<U+200B> this unreliable product.Thanks.\\n                                                                                               \n",
       "3 Really good and durable.\\n i bought itfor 999,I purchased it second time, gifted first one to brother. This is really good.Sound quality is really good.You can connect 2 devices at a time.I connect laptop and mobile both.when listening muaic on Lappy, if u get a call, it switches to mobile,this switch between device is not good but again in this price its awesome.Battery stand by is 36 hours for me, and i have used it continously for 8 hours in one go. So Battery life is pretty awesome.Comfortable on ear.\\n\n",

    "###  Conclusions from the initial analysis of good/bad reviews\n",
    "\n",
    "The most notable finding is that the top four terms in the good review set are the 2nd-5th terms in the bad review set (excluding the top term, \"not\"). \"Good\" ranks very highly on the bad review set, which is fairly counterintuitive. My theory is that since only individual tokens are used (instead of using n-grams), some of these terms are taken out of context - good may actually be \"not good\". Another theory is that because these reviews are on a scale from 1-5, the content of the review may be both positive and negative, especially in the middle of the scale. This leads to many terms being shared between the sets.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another interesting conclusion is how there are more important words in the bad review set than there are in the good review set (138 vs 114). Considering how the bad review set included only 34.4% of the total reviews, I would have expected fewer words in the bad review DTM.\n",
    "\n",
    "One possible explanation is that people tend to be more comprehensive when leaving bad reviews\n",
    "* Many good reviews focus on customer sentiment\n",
    "\n",
    ">'Just go for it\\n **Awesome best budget** wireless earphones\\n'\n",
    "\n",
    ">'**SUPERB**\\n **Sound quality is good**. noise cancellation is not upto the mark. **battery quality is decent**. by charging it once you can enjoy upto 5hrs of music without any issue\\n'\n",
    "* Bad reviews are often more detailed to emphasize discontent\n",
    "\n",
    ">'Honest review of an edm music lover\\n No doubt it has a great bass and to a great extent noise cancellation and decent sound clarity and mindblowing battery but the following **dissapointed** me though i tried a lot to adjust.1.**Bluetooth range not more than 10m2. Pain in ear due the conical buds(can be removed)3. Wires are a bit long which makes it odd in front.4. No pouch provided.5. Worst part is very low quality and distoring mic**. Other person keeps complaining about my voice.\\n'\n",
    "\n",
    ">'Review update - **Product failed after a few months**\\n Update: Sadly this is the **second Boat product to conk off after few months of use**. I guess this is the end of the journey for you and I Boat Audio, **not buying any more products from your brand**. Changed the rating to reflect the same.I was in the market for a cheap pair of Bluetooth earphones and I chanced upon this on a lightning deal and bought it. I have used Boat products before, they have good build quality and their sound is alright. I’m writing this after a month or so, enough time to have lived with it and get to know quirks and other problems.• **The sound is nothing great**, it’s a bit on the bassy side. If you’re a bass lover, this is definitely a good buy.• Connectivity is quick and painless – and it works without hassle every time. **The quality of the connectivity depends and is sometimes weird**. I can put the phone on charge and use it for a distance of about 3 meters, no worries. But sometimes when I’m walking really fast or jogging there are breaks and crackles in audio. Not sure if it’s the material of my gym wear, but it works well when the phone’s in my jeans.• **Battery life is nothing to write home about** – I listen to music constantly even when I’m at work. My demands are probably too high for this price range.• It is sweat-proof as advertised. No interruptions under a light drizzle.• It’s got great build quality for the price – looks and feels premium. Doesn’t tangle at all.• It stays in your ear regardless of the intensity of the exercise which is great.On the whole a great buy if you are looking for a cheaper alternative. Wait for a sale before you get it though.Like my reviews? Please do click the helpful button. It encourages me to share more about the products I use. Thanks!\\n'\n",

    "### Adjusting the weights according to importance in good/bad reviews\n",
    "\n",
    "To lessen the influence of shared terms, I decided to implement a custom scheme that mirrors term frequency - inverse document frequency (TF-IDF). TF-IDF is a combination of two separate methods. Term frequency is just the frequency that a term occurs in a document (if normalized, then it is also divided by the number of terms in the document). Inverse document frequency measures the importance of a term by taking the natural log of the total number of documents divided by the number of documents with a given term in it.\n",
    "\n",
    "TFIDF = Num occurences of a term in a document * ln( {Total num documents} / {Num documents containing the term} )\n",
    "\n",
    "$$Weight_{new} = Weight * \\frac{Weight}{Total}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "For my variation, first, I will build a separate DTM for both the good and bad review sets (gDTM, bDTM). I will then calculate the term frequencies for every term that appears in either set (g_TF, b_TF), as well as the inverse document frequency within either set (g_idf, b_idf). I will then extract all terms that are shared between the two review sets (inboth_df).\n",
